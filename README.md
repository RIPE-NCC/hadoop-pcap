Screencast
----------

We have created a screencast showing the use of the Hadoop PCAP SerDe in Hive using [Amazon Elastic MapReduce](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/).

Components
----------

This project consists of two components:

### Library

Bundles the code used to read PCAPs. Can be used within MapReduce jobs to natively read PCAP files.  
See: https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/hadoop-pcap/tree/master/hadoop-pcap-lib

### SerDe

Implements a Hive Serializer/Deserializer (SerDe) to query PCAPs using SQL like commands.
